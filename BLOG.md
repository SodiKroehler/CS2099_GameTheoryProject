four methods:

BASE: baseline: random distribution
SCSOP: single csop: maximize U_d_1 - aka minimize player utilities
DCSOP: double csop: minimize player utility, maximize player reward
DCSOPT: double csop thresh = minimize player utility, maximize player reward, per-target thresholds.



utilty of player i for target t = thresh_t - r_t
reward for player i for target t = manually defined
